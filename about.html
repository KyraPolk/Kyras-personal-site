      <h3>Traveling</h3>

      <p>Traveling is something I am extremely passionate about. God did not put us on this beautiful and vast earth just for us to stay
        in one spot our entire lives. I make it point to travel at least 4-6 times a year if not more. I have a small goal of seeing at least
        30 different countries by the time of my 30th birthday. I've traveled so many beautiful and stunning places like: Iceland, France, Monaco,
         Ireland, Aruba, and many states throughout the U.S. Life is far to short and unpredictable so I strive to live and explore as far and as often as possible. A few
         places I have on my itinerary next are: Hawaii in January, Bahamas in March or April, and another tour of Europe visiting 5 new countries in August.

      <h3>Trying New Experiences</h3>

      <p>I love trying new things, from food, to places, and experiences. In this photo, Im in a dry suit snorkeling the frigid waters of Silfra fissure in Iceland in 37 degree waters.
        The significance is that it was the only place in the world where you could swim in crystal clear water directly between two continents: North America and Europe. The rarer the experience, the better.
        I have also done things like: white water rafting, cliff jumping, mixology classes, zip ling in a rain forest, dinner at the top of the world restaurant and more. I plan to cross things off my bucket list like: skydiving,
         being on a tv show/game show, learning how to do the Argentine tango, swimming with sharks, and believe me so much more!

      <h3>Spending Time With Family & Friends</h3>

      <p>I am the definition of a family girl. I have an amazing spouse that supports every single idea and dream I fabricate and present to him. He's truly my best friend and copilot. I have a loving and charismatic family that loves and cherishes me
         and the more I grow in my education, self development, and soon my career, I want to give back and become a mentor for my youngest family members. Family comes first always. Friends are just the family you
          choose and I am blessed to have friends that consistently show up for me through the thick and the thin.  </p>

      <h3>Reading</h3>

      <p>Reading is far from outdated. Reading is a habit of the wealthiest people on this Earth. I read mostly romance novels and books on self development. Most of my reading occurs right before bedtime. Sometimes when a book is really good and I
        can't seem to put it down, I end up staying up far too late hanging on every word. Here are just a handful of books I have read.....</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins</li>
          <li>"The Compound Effect" by Darren Hardy</li>
          <li>"Mind Full to Mindful" by Om Swami</li>
          <li>"Make Your Bed" by William H. McRaven</li>
          <li>"Fifty Shades of Grey" by E.L. James</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
