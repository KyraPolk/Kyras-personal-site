  <p>Hello all! Welcome to an insight into everything me as not
     only a professional fullstack developer, but as an unique
     individual with character, hobbies, and passions. Born and
     raised in Louisiana I have always had dreams and ambitions
      larger than myself for my career path, hobbies, and self-character
       development. I've recently discovered the fun of creation and
        developing websites using CSS and HTML.</p>
